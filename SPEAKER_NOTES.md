# chompAR Presentation - Speaker Notes

## Slide 1: Intro
- **chompAR** = street art game combining AR technology with gamification
- Goal: Train attention + appropriate public space
- Made at FAMU (Film Academy) in Prague
- Not just another app - it's an artistic intervention

---

## Slide 2: Photos
- Real paste-ups placed around Prague
- "Chomps" are the characters you hunt
- Physical street art + digital layer
- Each location is carefully chosen

---

## Slide 3: Three Pillars
- Theoretical framework behind the project
- Three interconnected concepts:
  1. Attention Ecology
  2. Right to the City  
  3. Détournement
- Not just a game - has philosophical foundation

---

## Slide 4: Attention Ecology
- **Problem**: People don't look around themselves
- Phones capture all attention
- Urban environment becomes invisible
- chompAR uses phone to redirect attention BACK to physical world
- Paradox: using screen addiction against itself

---

## Slide 5: Right to the City
- **Problem**: People don't consider the city theirs
- Henri Lefebvre's concept (1968)
- Public space controlled by corporations & ads
- chompAR lets players CLAIM pieces of the city
- Symbolic ownership through play

---

## Slide 6: Détournement
- Situationist International concept
- Using technology AGAINST technology
- AR usually used for ads & commerce
- We use AR for art & freedom
- Subverting the tool's original purpose

---

## Slide 7: Two Modes
**Solo Mode (Ambient)**
- Personal collection
- No competition
- Ownership is permanent
- Pure attention training

**Battle Mode (Competitive)**
- Red vs Blue teams
- Claim territories
- Can be recaptured
- Public space appropriation in action

---

## Slide 8: Predecessors
**Pokémon GO**
- Proved location-based AR works
- Massive cultural impact
- We take the concept further

**Invader (Street Artist)**
- Real-world gamification of street art
- Points, achievements, maps
- Direct inspiration for scoring system

---

## Slide 9: Privacy-first
- **No GPS tracking** - we don't know where you are
- **Local profile** - data stays in YOUR browser
- **No registration** - no email, no account
- **20-minute delay** on map - prevents stalking
- Phone as SECONDARY tool (not primary)

---

## Slide 10: Demo
- Live demonstration
- Audience can scan the target with their phones
- Show how the AR recognition works
- (Have backup if demo fails)

---

## Slide 11: Anifilm 2026
- Festival collaboration in March 2026
- 12 paste-ups around Liberec
- Collecting animation "frames"
- Complete collection = 2 second animation
- Collective CRT display at festival
- Theme: HORA (mountain)

---

## Slide 12: Questions
**Discussion topics:**
- Two modes: which is more important?
- Need for additional theory?
- Ambient path: can games be non-competitive?

Open floor for audience questions.
